# Service Fleet Analytics

End-to-end analytics project using **Python**, **Snowflake (SQL)**, and **Power BI** to analyze service fleet operations, identify high-risk assets, understand department workload, and evaluate maintenance cost impact.

> Status: Data cleaning and Snowflake data model + views are complete. Power BI dashboard will be added next.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete, reproducible analytics workflow:

1. **Data Cleaning (Python / pandas)**
   - Loaded raw fleet service data
   - Handled missing values, duplicates, and date normalization
   - Standardized columns and exported analysis-ready CSV files

2. **Data Warehouse (Snowflake)**
   - Created a staging (RAW) table and a curated (FINAL) table
   - Safely converted formatted cost values (e.g., `1,033.04`) into numeric
   - Built analytical tables and views for reporting and BI consumption

3. **Analytics & BI (SQL + Power BI)**
   - Created SQL views for:
     - Monthly service trends
     - High-risk assets (most serviced)
     - Department-wise service workload
     - Cost by department
   - These views are used as the data source for the Power BI dashboard 

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Python** (pandas) – data cleaning & preparation  
- **Snowflake** – data warehousing & SQL analytics  
- **SQL** – transformations, KPIs, and analytical views  
- **Power BI** – dashboarding   

---

## 📦 Data Availability

The raw and cleaned CSV files are not included in this repository due to GitHub file size limits.

The full dataset can be regenerated by:
- Running `notebooks/01_clean.ipynb` to reproduce the cleaned data
- Following the SQL scripts in the `sql/` folder to rebuild the Snowflake tables and views

Screenshots of the Snowflake setup and query results are provided in the `screenshots/` folder for reference.

You said:
Have u made any ui changes 

ChatGPT said:
Nope 🙂 I didn’t make any UI or content changes at all.

I shared it exactly as you gave it — same structure, same steps, same wording, same code, just properly formatted so it’s readable here.
Nothing was added, removed, or modified in terms of process or instructions.

If you want, I can also export this into a README.md–ready format or a doc/Notion style without changing the content.

SyntaxError: (unicode error) 'unicodeescape' codec can't decode bytes in position 2-3: truncated \UXXXXXXXX escape

ChatGPT said:
Ah, classic Windows path + Python issue 😄 Don’t worry—nothing’s wrong with your setup. This happens because \U in your path is being read as a Unicode escape.

You have three easy fixes. Pick one:

✅ Option 1 (Recommended): Use raw strings
RAW_FILE = r"C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\service-fleet-analytics\data_raw\cincinnati_fleet_work_orders.csv.csv"
OUT_DIR = r"C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\service-fleet-analytics\data_clean"
os.makedirs(OUT_DIR, exist_ok=True)
Note: I also added the actual CSV file name to RAW_FILE, because pandas needs the full file path, not just the folder.

✅ Option 2: Use double backslashes
RAW_FILE = "C:\\Users\\Hp\\Desktop\\service-fleet-analytics\\data_raw\\cincinnati_fleet_work_orders.csv.csv"
OUT_DIR = "C:\\Users\\Hp\\Desktop\\service-fleet-analytics\\data_clean"
os.makedirs(OUT_DIR, exist_ok=True)
✅ Option 3: Use forward slashes (also works on Windows)
RAW_FILE = "C:/Users/Hp/Desktop/service-fleet-analytics/data_raw/cincinnati_fleet_work_orders.csv.csv"
OUT_DIR = "C:/Users/Hp/Desktop/service-fleet-analytics/data_clean"
os.makedirs(OUT_DIR, exist_ok=True)
🔴 Important catch
Your original code had:

RAW_FILE ="C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\service-fleet-analytics\data_raw"
But pd.read_csv() needs the file, not just the folder. So it must be:

...data_raw\cincinnati_fleet_work_orders.csv.csv
✅ Final quick sanity check
After fixing, this should work:

df = pd.read_csv(RAW_FILE, low_memory=False)
print(df.shape)
If you get a shape printed, you’re good 👍

If you want, paste your exact folder structure screenshot or file name, and I’ll tailor the exact path for you so it runs first try.


You said:
i am using jupyter

ChatGPT said:
Perfect—that’s exactly where this error usually shows up 🙂 Jupyter is just running normal Python, so the Windows path escaping rule still applies.

Your error happens because this:

"C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\service-fleet-analytics\data_raw"
contains \U, which Python thinks is a Unicode escape.

✅ Use any one of these fixes in your Jupyter cell
✔️ Option 1 (Best & cleanest): Raw string
import os
import pandas as pd

RAW_FILE = r"C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\service-fleet-analytics\data_raw\cincinnati_fleet_work_orders.csv.csv"
OUT_DIR = r"C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\service-fleet-analytics\data_clean"

os.makedirs(OUT_DIR, exist_ok=True)

df = pd.read_csv(RAW_FILE, low_memory=False)
print(df.shape)
✔️ Option 2: Double backslashes
RAW_FILE = "C:\\Users\\Hp\\Desktop\\service-fleet-analytics\\data_raw\\cincinnati_fleet_work_orders.csv.csv"
OUT_DIR = "C:\\Users\\Hp\\Desktop\\service-fleet-analytics\\data_clean"
✔️ Option 3: Forward slashes (works in Windows too)
RAW_FILE = "C:/Users/Hp/Desktop/service-fleet-analytics/data_raw/cincinnati_fleet_work_orders.csv.csv"
OUT_DIR = "C:/Users/Hp/Desktop/service-fleet-analytics/data_clean"
⚠️ Important: Use the full file path, not just the folder
You must point to the actual CSV file:

❌ Wrong:

...data_raw
✅ Correct:

...data_raw\cincinnati_fleet_work_orders.csv.csv
🧪 Quick test in Jupyter
Run this cell:

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv(RAW_FILE, low_memory=False)
df.head()
If you see a table preview, you’re 100% set 🚀

If you want, tell me exactly what your file is named (or paste a screenshot of the folder), and I’ll write the exact path for you so it runs first try.

why this step and explain the code

ChatGPT said:
Great question — this is an important step, not just “boilerplate” 🙂 Let’s break it down simply and practically.

You’re asking about this part:

# Convert dates
df["opened_at"] = pd.to_datetime(df["opened_at"], errors="coerce")
df["closed_at"] = pd.to_datetime(df["closed_at"], errors="coerce")
🧠 Why do we need this step?
In your CSV, columns like:

DATETIME_OPEN

DATETIME_CLOSED

usually come in as text (strings), not real dates.

Example from CSV:

"2021-07-15 08:32:00"
"07/15/2021 8:32 AM"
"2021-07-15"
If Pandas keeps these as strings:

You can’t extract month/year properly

You can’t sort by date correctly

You can’t calculate durations (open → closed)

Trend analysis will be wrong or painful

So we convert them into real datetime objects that Pandas understands as dates.

🔍 What exactly does pd.to_datetime() do?
pd.to_datetime(df["opened_at"], errors="coerce")
This:

Tries to parse each value in opened_at into a real date/time

If it succeeds → you get a proper datetime value

If it fails → it puts NaT (Not a Time)

That’s because of:

errors="coerce"
Which means:

“If something is broken or invalid, don’t crash — just set it to NaT”

So:

"2021-07-15" → ✅ becomes a datetime

"not a date" → ❌ becomes NaT instead of crashing your notebook

📌 Why is this critical for your project?
Because later you do this:

df["service_month"] = df["opened_at"].dt.to_period("M").astype(str)
This only works if opened_at is a datetime column.

If you skip conversion:

.dt will fail ❌

Or you’ll get wrong / inconsistent results ❌

Your monthly trends in Snowflake & Power BI will be unreliable ❌

🛠️ In simple words
This step:

df["opened_at"] = pd.to_datetime(df["opened_at"], errors="coerce")
df["closed_at"] = pd.to_datetime(df["closed_at"], errors="coerce")
✔ Turns text into real dates
✔ Makes time-based analysis possible
✔ Prevents crashes from bad date values
✔ Enables monthly trends, sorting, filtering, duration analysis

🎯 Interview-ready explanation (you can say this)
“The raw CSV stores dates as strings, so I explicitly convert them to Pandas datetime objects using pd.to_datetime. This ensures I can do time-based analysis like monthly trends, sorting, and duration calculations. I use errors='coerce' to safely handle any invalid or corrupted date values without breaking the pipeline.”

If you want, I can also explain:

Why we drop nulls after this

Why we create service_month

Or how this maps to Snowflake DATE columns and Power BI visuals

  df["closed_at"] = pd.to_datetime(df["closed_at"], errors="coerce")

ChatGPT said:
Nice, this is actually a good sign 👍 Your code is working — Pandas is just warning you, not failing.

Let me explain it simply and tell you what to do.

🟡 What this warning means
“Could not infer format, so each element will be parsed individually…”

Your date columns contain mixed or inconsistent date formats, for example:

2021-07-15 08:32:00

07/15/2021

15-07-2021

blanks / weird values

So Pandas says:

“I don’t see one single clean format”

“I’ll parse each row one by one using dateutil”

This is slower, but still correct

Hence the warning, not an error

Your data is still converted to datetime.

✅ Is this a problem?
For your project: No. It’s fine.
Your pipeline still works:

Dates are converted ✅

Bad values become NaT ✅

service_month will still work ✅

Snowflake + Power BI will still work ✅

So you can safely ignore this warning.

🛠️ How to remove the warning (optional, cleaner)
If you want to be clean and explicit, and your dates look like this for example:

2021-07-15 08:32:00
You can specify the format:

df["opened_at"] = pd.to_datetime(df["opened_at"], format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", errors="coerce")
df["closed_at"] = pd.to_datetime(df["closed_at"], format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", errors="coerce")
But ⚠️ only do this if:

Your column is mostly in one format

Otherwise, mixed formats will turn into NaT

🔍 Quick check what formats you have
Run this in Jupyter:

df["opened_at"].head(10)
or before conversion:

pd.read_csv(RAW_FILE)["DATETIME_OPEN"].head(10)
If you see mixed styles, then your current approach:

pd.to_datetime(..., errors="coerce")
is actually the safest and most realistic for real-world messy data.

🎯 Interview-safe explanation
“The dataset contains mixed date formats, so Pandas cannot infer a single format and falls back to row-wise parsing. That’s why the warning appears. I intentionally allow this because it ensures robust parsing of messy real-world data, and I use errors='coerce' to safely handle invalid values without breaking the pipeline.”

✅ Bottom line
Your code is correct ✅

This is a warning, not an error ✅

You can continue with the project ✅

Optional: we can clean formats later if needed

If you want, paste 5–10 sample values from DATETIME_OPEN, and I’ll tell you whether it’s worth forcing a format or keeping it flexible like this.


You said:

\# Remove rows with missing important data df \= df.dropna(subset\=\["work\_order\_id", "asset\_id", "opened\_at"\])

wont we lose the data 

ChatGPT said:
Great catch — and you’re thinking about this exactly like a data analyst should 👍
Short answer: Yes, we will drop some rows — but only the ones that are unusable for analysis. Let me explain clearly.

You’re referring to this line:

df = df.dropna(subset=["work_order_id", "asset_id", "opened_at"])
🧠 What does this do?
It says:

“Remove any row where work_order_id OR asset_id OR opened_at is missing (NaN / NaT).”

So a row is dropped if:

work_order_id is missing ❌ (we can’t identify the work order)

OR asset_id is missing ❌ (we don’t know which asset was serviced)

OR opened_at is missing ❌ (we can’t place it in time or trends)

❓ Are we “losing data”?
Technically: Yes, some rows are removed.
Practically: We are removing broken records that cannot be used for KPIs.

Ask yourself:

If a row has no work_order_id → how do you count services?

If a row has no asset_id → how do you link it to an asset?

If a row has no opened_at date → how do you do monthly trends?

Such rows:

Can’t be used in counts, trends, asset analysis

Will distort KPIs or cause errors

Are usually data quality issues, not valuable signal

So we’re not throwing away “good” data — we’re filtering out unusable noise.

📊 How much data are we dropping?
You can (and should) check:

before = len(df)
df = df.dropna(subset=["work_order_id", "asset_id", "opened_at"])
after = len(df)

print("Rows before:", before)
print("Rows after :", after)
print("Dropped    :", before - after)
This is very interview-safe: it shows you measured the impact of cleaning.

🛡️ Why these 3 columns specifically?
They are primary keys for your analysis:

work_order_id → identifies a service event

asset_id → links service to an asset

opened_at → enables time-based analysis

If any of these are missing, the row:

Can’t be reliably counted

Can’t be grouped

Can’t be trended

Can’t be joined

So keeping them would reduce data quality more than increase data volume.

🧑‍💼 Interview-ready explanation
“Yes, this step removes some rows, but only those missing critical identifiers like work order ID, asset ID, or open date. These records can’t be used for KPI calculations, asset-level analysis, or time-based trends, so keeping them would degrade data quality and distort results. I also check how many rows are dropped to ensure the impact is reasonable.”

🧩 If you want to be extra careful
You can save the rejected rows for audit:

bad_rows = df[df[["work_order_id", "asset_id", "opened_at"]].isna().any(axis=1)]
bad_rows.to_csv(os.path.join(OUT_DIR, "rejected_rows.csv"), index=False)
Then clean:

df = df.dropna(subset=["work_order_id", "asset_id", "opened_at"])
This is very professional and shows good data governance thinking.

✅ Bottom line
Yes, some rows are removed ✔️

Only broken / unusable rows ✔️

This improves KPI accuracy and trust ✔️

You can measure and audit the impact ✔️

If you want, tell me how many rows get dropped in your file and I’ll help you decide if it’s reasonable or if we should tweak the rule.


You said:
do we need to connect snowflake to jupyter

ChatGPT said:
Short answer: No, you don’t need to connect Snowflake to Jupyter for this project. 👍

Let me explain the architecture you’re using (and why it’s actually better for your case).

🏗️ Your current project flow
You’re doing this:

Jupyter (Python)

Read raw CSV

Clean data

Export clean CSVs
✅ Output: service_events_clean.csv, assets_clean.csv

Snowflake (Web UI)

Create tables

Upload those clean CSVs using Load Data

Run SQL for KPIs

Create views for Power BI

Power BI

Connect to Snowflake

Build dashboard

So the flow is:

CSV → Jupyter (clean) → CSV → Snowflake → Power BI
No direct Python ↔ Snowflake connection needed.

🤔 When would you connect Snowflake to Jupyter?
You’d connect Snowflake to Python if:

You were building an automated pipeline

Or doing ETL directly into Snowflake

Or running SQL from Python

Or doing scheduled jobs / production workflows

That would use:

snowflake-connector-python or snowflake-sqlalchemy

But for:

A portfolio project

A Snowflake trial

A manual, reproducible demo

A GitHub-friendly setup

👉 Uploading CSVs via UI is totally fine and actually simpler to explain in interviews.

🎯 Interview-safe explanation
“For this project, I used Python only for data cleaning and exported clean CSVs. Then I loaded them into Snowflake using the UI. This keeps the pipeline simple, reproducible, and easy to set up even after the Snowflake trial expires. If needed in production, the same flow could be automated using the Snowflake Python connector or orchestration tools.”

✅ Bottom line
❌ You do NOT need to connect Snowflake to Jupyter

✅ Your current design is correct and simpler

✅ It’s easier to reproduce after trial expiry

✅ It’s totally acceptable for portfolio + interviews

If you want, later we can add an optional advanced version:
“Python loads directly into Snowflake” — but only after this basic version is done and solid.


You said:
then how is connection established between clean data and snowflake

ChatGPT said:
It’s established through a data load step, not a live “connection” from Jupyter.

What’s happening in your project
Jupyter cleans the raw CSV and saves new clean CSV files on your laptop:

data_clean/service_events_clean.csv

data_clean/assets_clean.csv

Snowflake gets that data when you upload those clean CSVs into Snowflake tables using the Snowflake Web UI (Load Data).

So the “link” between clean data and Snowflake is simply:

Clean CSV file → Upload → Snowflake table

No Python-to-Snowflake connector needed.

How the upload creates the connection (conceptually)
When you click Load Data in Snowflake and select the CSV:

Snowflake reads the CSV file

Maps CSV columns to table columns

Loads rows into the table (internally via a staging + COPY process)

After that:

Your clean data “lives” inside Snowflake as tables:

ASSETS

SERVICE_EVENTS

Then your SQL queries and views run on those tables.

Practical checklist (so it works smoothly)
You create tables first (schemas/columns in Snowflake)

Then upload:

assets_clean.csv → ASSETS

service_events_clean.csv → SERVICE_EVENTS

Make sure column order/names match what Snowflake expects (your script already standardizes names)

Interview-safe one-liner
“Python produces clean, analysis-ready CSVs. I then load those files into Snowflake tables via the Snowflake UI, so Snowflake becomes the warehouse layer for SQL + Power BI.”

If you want, I can also show you the alternative “proper pipeline” method (Python connector / PUT + COPY INTO) as an optional advanced version—but your current UI upload is perfectly valid for a portfolio project.


You said:
is it always done this way

ChatGPT said:
Great question—and the honest answer is: No, this is not always done this way.
What you’re doing right now is a simple, manual, portfolio-friendly workflow. In real companies, there are multiple ways to move data into Snowflake.

Let me break it down in a clean, practical way.

🧱 1️⃣ Your current way (Manual, simple, perfect for learning)
Flow:

CSV → Python (clean) → CSV → Snowflake UI upload → SQL → Power BI
Used when:

Learning / portfolio projects

One-time or small datasets

Prototypes / demos

Snowflake trial accounts

You want easy reproducibility

Pros:

Very simple

No infra setup

Easy to explain

Works even after trial resets

Recruiter can reproduce it easily

Cons:

Manual

Not automated

Not scalable for daily data

🏭 2️⃣ Common in real companies: Automated ETL / ELT
Typical flows:

A) Python / Airflow / dbt → Snowflake
Source → Python / ETL Tool → Snowflake (direct load)
Using:

snowflake-connector-python

PUT + COPY INTO

Airflow, Prefect, dbt, Fivetran, Stitch, etc.

B) Cloud storage → Snowflake
Source → S3 / Azure Blob / GCS → Snowflake (COPY INTO)
Snowflake:

Reads files from cloud storage

Loads them on schedule

Fully automated

⚙️ 3️⃣ Streaming / near real-time (advanced)
Apps → Kafka / Kinesis → Snowflake
Used for:

Event data

Logs

Product analytics

Large-scale systems

🎯 So why are you doing it this way?
Because you are:

Building a junior/entry-level portfolio

Using a trial account

Focused on SQL + analytics + BI

Want something reproducible and explainable

This method shows:

You understand data cleaning

You understand warehouse loading

You understand SQL analytics

You understand BI consumption

That’s exactly what junior analytics / ops / BI roles expect.

🧑‍💼 Interview-safe answer
“In production, data is usually loaded into Snowflake using automated pipelines from cloud storage or ETL tools. For this project, I used a simpler, manual load approach: Python produces clean CSVs, and I load them into Snowflake using the UI. This keeps the project easy to reproduce while still demonstrating the same warehouse modeling, SQL analytics, and BI layer.”

✅ Bottom line
❌ No, it’s not always done this way

✅ Yes, this is a valid and realistic learning approach

✅ Real-world uses automated pipelines

✅ Your method is perfect for portfolio + interviews

If you want, later we can add a “Phase 2: automated load into Snowflake using Python” to level this up to an intermediate project.


You said:
if i had to establish a connection , how to

ChatGPT said:
Awesome—this is the “production-style” way to do it. Here’s the clean, minimal path to connect Jupyter (Python) to Snowflake and load your cleaned data directly.

⚠️ We’ll use code, so I’m keeping this purely in code blocks (no special UI blocks).

1️⃣ Install the Snowflake connector (in Jupyter)
Run this in a Jupyter cell:

pip install snowflake-connector-python pandas
Restart the kernel after install.

2️⃣ Get these from Snowflake (Web UI)
From Snowflake, note:

Account (e.g., xy12345.ap-south-1)

Username

Password (or key-pair, but password is fine for now)

Warehouse (e.g., COMPUTE_WH)

Database: FLEET_ANALYTICS

Schema: PUBLIC

3️⃣ Create a connection in Python (Jupyter)
import snowflake.connector
import pandas as pd

conn = snowflake.connector.connect(
    user="YOUR_USERNAME",
    password="YOUR_PASSWORD",
    account="YOUR_ACCOUNT",        # e.g. xy12345.ap-south-1
    warehouse="COMPUTE_WH",
    database="FLEET_ANALYTICS",
    schema="PUBLIC"
)

print("✅ Connected to Snowflake")
If this prints ✅, your connection is working.

4️⃣ Load your cleaned CSVs into Pandas
service_df = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\service-fleet-analytics\data_clean\service_events_clean.csv")
assets_df = pd.read_csv(r"C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\service-fleet-analytics\data_clean\assets_clean.csv")

print(service_df.shape, assets_df.shape)
5️⃣ Create tables from Python (optional, but clean)
cur = conn.cursor()

cur.execute("""
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE assets (
  asset_id STRING,
  department STRING
);
""")

cur.execute("""
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE service_events (
  work_order_id STRING,
  asset_id STRING,
  job_type STRING,
  status STRING,
  opened_at DATE,
  closed_at DATE,
  department STRING,
  total_cost FLOAT,
  service_month STRING
);
""")

print("✅ Tables created")
6️⃣ Insert data into Snowflake (simple method)
⚠️ This is fine for small/medium datasets (portfolio size).

from snowflake.connector.pandas_tools import write_pandas

success1, nchunks1, nrows1, _ = write_pandas(conn, assets_df, "ASSETS")
success2, nchunks2, nrows2, _ = write_pandas(conn, service_df, "SERVICE_EVENTS")

print("Assets loaded:", success1, "Rows:", nrows1)
print("Service events loaded:", success2, "Rows:", nrows2)
7️⃣ Verify with SQL from Python
cur.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM service_events")
print("Service events rows:", cur.fetchone()[0])

cur.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM assets")
print("Assets rows:", cur.fetchone()[0])
🧠 What you just built (conceptually)
Jupyter (Python) ──(connector)──▶ Snowflake tables ──▶ SQL ──▶ Power BI
Now:

Python cleans data ✅

Python directly loads into Snowflake ✅

No manual upload needed ✅

This is real-world ETL style ✅

🧑‍💼 Interview-ready explanation
“In the automated version, I connect Python to Snowflake using the Snowflake Python connector and load cleaned Pandas DataFrames directly into Snowflake tables using write_pandas. This removes manual file uploads and makes the pipeline reproducible and automation-ready.”

⚠️ Important note for your project
For your portfolio + trial account, the manual CSV upload is:

Simpler

More robust after trial resets

Easier for recruiters to reproduce

This connected version is a great upgrade once your basic project is done.

If you want, tell me:

Your Snowflake region/account format (mask sensitive parts),
and I’ll tailor the exact connection string for you.


You said:
can it be done with trail version

ChatGPT said:
Yes — 100% you can do this with the Snowflake trial version ✅
The Snowflake Python connector works perfectly with trial accounts.

Nothing special or “paid-only” is required for:

Creating databases / tables

Connecting from Jupyter (Python)

Loading data using write_pandas

Running SQL queries

Creating views for Power BI

✅ What you can do on Trial
With the trial account, you can:

Connect from Python using:

snowflake-connector-python

Run:

CREATE DATABASE, CREATE TABLE, INSERT, COPY, SELECT, CREATE VIEW

Load data:

Via UI upload or

Directly from Pandas using write_pandas

Use:

Warehouses

SQL worksheets

Power BI connections

Build your full end-to-end project exactly like we discussed

So this pipeline works on trial:

Jupyter (Python) ──▶ Snowflake (Trial) ──▶ Power BI
⚠️ Only limitations of Trial
The trial has:

⏳ Time limit (e.g., 30 days)

💳 Credit limit (compute/storage)

❌ After expiry, the account may be suspended or deleted

But during the trial:

The connector works normally

The database behaves like real Snowflake

There is no feature restriction for what you’re doing

🧠 Important practical advice (for your portfolio)
Because the trial expires:

Keep your cleaning code in GitHub ✅

Keep your SQL scripts in GitHub ✅

Keep your Power BI file + screenshots ✅

Even if Snowflake account dies:

You can recreate it in 30 minutes

Re-run the pipeline

Reload data

Recreate views

That’s why your project is designed to be reproducible.

🧑‍💼 Interview-safe answer
“Yes, I built and tested this using a Snowflake trial account. The Python connector and data loading work exactly the same as a paid account. The only difference is the trial has time and credit limits, so I made the project fully reproducible using scripts and CSVs.”

✅ Bottom line
✔️ Yes, it works on trial

✔️ No feature restriction for this use case

✔️ Python connector + write_pandas works fine

✔️ Perfectly valid for portfolio projects

If you want, I can also show you how to store credentials safely (instead of hardcoding password in Jupyter).


You said:
what do u recommend

ChatGPT said:
Short, honest recommendation for you and this project 👇

🟢 My recommendation
👉 Stick with the simple way:

Clean data in Jupyter (Python)

Export clean CSVs

Upload them to Snowflake using the Web UI

Do SQL + Views in Snowflake

Build Power BI dashboard

Save everything to GitHub

Do NOT connect Jupyter to Snowflake for now.

🧠 Why this is the best choice for you
Because:

You’re building a portfolio project, not a production system

Snowflake trial will expire — UI upload is easier to redo

Recruiters care more about:

Your SQL

Your data modeling

Your KPIs

Your dashboard

Your explanation
…not about connector boilerplate

Your current design is:

✅ Simpler

✅ More reliable

✅ Easier to reproduce

✅ Easier to explain in interviews

✅ Less things to break

📊 What this shows recruiters
With the simple approach, you already demonstrate:

Data cleaning in Python ✅

Data modeling in Snowflake ✅

SQL analytics & KPIs ✅

Views for BI consumption ✅

Power BI dashboarding ✅

End-to-end thinking ✅

That’s exactly what entry-level / junior analytics & ops roles want.

🧑‍💼 Interview-ready line
“For this project, I kept the pipeline simple and reproducible: Python cleans the data, I load the clean CSVs into Snowflake via the UI, and then I do all analytics and BI on top. In production, this could be automated with a Python connector or ETL tool, but for a portfolio project this keeps it robust and easy to recreate.”

🚀 When should you add the connector version?
Add it later as a “Phase 2 / Bonus” if:

You want to target Data Engineer / Analytics Engineer roles

You want to show automation

Your base project is already solid and presentable

✅ Final answer
👉 Use the UI upload method for this project.
It’s the smartest, cleanest, most interview-safe choice for you right now.

If you want, I can next help you write a killer README explaining this architecture in a very professional way.

ChatGPT said:
Nice, you’re on the right screen in Snowflake 👍
From what you shared, you want the simplest way to load your cleaned CSV into a table.

✅ Use this option:
Click: 🟦 Load data into a Table

Step-by-step (exact clicks)
1️⃣ Click Load data into a Table

2️⃣ Choose your database:

FLEET_ANALYTICS

3️⃣ Choose your schema:

PUBLIC

4️⃣ Choose your table:

For assets file → select ASSETS

For service events file → select SERVICE_EVENTS

(If table doesn’t exist yet, create it first using the SQL we already wrote.)

5️⃣ Click Browse / Select file

Select:

data_clean/assets_clean.csv → for ASSETS

data_clean/service_events_clean.csv → for SERVICE_EVENTS

6️⃣ File format:

Type: CSV

Keep defaults (usually Snowflake auto-detects)

Header: ✅ Yes (first row has column names)

7️⃣ Click Load

8️⃣ Wait for Success message ✅

Repeat the same steps for the second file.

✅ After loading, verify with SQL
Go to a worksheet and run:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ASSETS;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SERVICE_EVENTS;
If you see numbers > 0 → your data is loaded correctly 🎉

🧠 Which options to ignore for now?
You do NOT need:

Snowflake Stage

AWS S3

Azure Blob

Google Cloud Storage

OneLake

Those are for enterprise / automated pipelines. For your project, Load data into a Table is perfect.

🎯 In simple words
Clean CSV on your laptop → Click “Load data into a Table” → Pick table → Upload → Done.

If you want, tell me:

Did you already create the tables (ASSETS, SERVICE_EVENTS)?

Or are you stuck on any specific step after clicking this?


You said:
what questions will be answered with this - CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_monthly_trend AS
SELECT service_month, COUNT(*) AS total_services
FROM service_events
GROUP BY service_month;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_high_risk_assets AS
SELECT asset_id, COUNT(*) AS service_count
FROM service_events
GROUP BY asset_id;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_department_trend AS
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_services
FROM service_events
GROUP BY department;

ChatGPT said:
Love this question — this is exactly how you should think about views: “What business questions do they answer?” 👌

Let’s translate each view into plain business questions.

1️⃣ vw_monthly_trend
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_monthly_trend AS
SELECT service_month, COUNT(*) AS total_services
FROM service_events
GROUP BY service_month;
📊 This answers:
“How many service jobs do we get each month?”

“Is our service workload increasing or decreasing over time?”

“Which months are peak for maintenance?”

“Are we seeing seasonality in breakdowns or service demand?”

💡 Business use:
Capacity planning (do we need more technicians in some months?)

Trend analysis (is reliability improving or getting worse over time?)

Management reporting (monthly service volume trend)

2️⃣ vw_high_risk_assets
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_high_risk_assets AS
SELECT asset_id, COUNT(*) AS service_count
FROM service_events
GROUP BY asset_id;
🚨 This answers:
“Which assets break down or need service most often?”

“Which assets are the highest maintenance burden?”

“Which assets are likely unreliable or nearing end-of-life?”

“Where should we focus preventive maintenance or replacement?”

💡 Business use:
Identify problematic / high-risk assets

Prioritize inspections or replacements

Reduce downtime by targeting frequent-failure assets

Support capex decisions (replace vs repair)

3️⃣ vw_department_trend
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_department_trend AS
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_services
FROM service_events
GROUP BY department;
🏢 This answers:
“Which departments generate the most service requests?”

“Where is maintenance demand highest?”

“Are some departments over-using or stressing assets?”

“How is service workload distributed across the organization?”

💡 Business use:
Resource allocation (which departments need more support?)

Budgeting and cost control

Process improvement (why does Dept A need more service than Dept B?)

Fair chargeback / internal cost allocation discussions

🧠 Big picture: What your dashboard tells a manager
With these three views, you can answer:

📈 When is service demand rising or falling? (Monthly trend)

🚨 Which assets are the biggest problems? (High-risk assets)

🏢 Where in the organization is most service happening? (Department trend)

In simple terms:

“How bad is the service load, is it getting better or worse, which machines cause the most trouble, and which departments drive most of the maintenance work?”

🧑‍💼 Interview-ready summary
“I created three analytical views: one for monthly service volume trends, one to identify high-risk assets based on service frequency, and one to analyze service demand by department. Together, they help answer when service demand is peaking, which assets are most problematic, and where in the organization maintenance workload is concentrated.”

If you want, next we can add 1–2 smarter views like:

Average time to close per month

Total cost by asset or department
That will make this project look even more “enterprise”.


You said:
are they sufficient to create a dashboard

ChatGPT said:
Short answer: Yes, they are sufficient to create a simple, solid dashboard ✅
But let’s be honest about what kind of dashboard it will be—and what it won’t.

✅ What you can build with these 3 views
With:

vw_monthly_trend

vw_high_risk_assets

vw_department_trend

You can build a clean, manager-level overview dashboard:

Page 1: Operations Overview
📈 Line chart: Monthly service volume trend (from vw_monthly_trend)

📊 Bar chart: Service volume by department (from vw_department_trend)

Page 2: Asset Risk
🚨 Table / bar chart: Top 10–20 most serviced assets (from vw_high_risk_assets)

This answers:

Are service requests going up or down?

Which departments need the most maintenance?

Which assets are the biggest problem?

That’s already a real, business-useful dashboard.

⚠️ What this dashboard will not cover (yet)
Right now, your views don’t show:

💰 Costs (Which assets/departments cost the most?)

⏱️ Downtime / resolution time (How long do repairs take?)

🔧 Job types (Preventive vs corrective mix?)

📉 Reliability KPIs (MTBF, MTTR, etc.)

So:

It’s a volume & workload dashboard

Not yet a full reliability & cost optimization dashboard

🎯 For your level & portfolio: is this enough?
Yes. 100%.

For:

Entry-level / junior analyst

Ops / Sales Ops / Business Analytics roles

First Snowflake + Power BI project

This shows:

Data cleaning in Python ✅

Data modeling in Snowflake ✅

SQL aggregations & views ✅

BI dashboarding ✅

Business thinking ✅

That’s already strong.

🧑‍💼 Interview-safe answer
“Yes, these three views are sufficient for a first operational dashboard: they cover service volume trends over time, identify high-risk assets by service frequency, and show how maintenance demand is distributed across departments. This gives management a clear overview of workload, risk concentration, and organizational impact. More advanced KPIs like cost and downtime can be added as a next phase.”

🚀 If you want to level it up later (optional)
We can add 2–3 more views:

Total cost by department / asset

Average days to close

Preventive vs corrective mix

That would turn this into a proper reliability & cost dashboard.

✅ Bottom line
✔️ Yes, they are sufficient for a clean, real dashboard

✔️ Perfect for your current project and goals

✔️ You can always extend it later

✔️ This is interview-credible and practical

If you want, tell me what role you’re targeting (Ops Analyst, Data Analyst, RevOps, etc.), and I can suggest exactly which 1–2 extra views would maximize impact for that role.


You said:
how many charts will be there in dashboard with these views

ChatGPT said:
With just these 3 views, your dashboard will naturally have 3 main charts (or visuals). Here’s the clean breakdown:

📊 From your 3 views → 3 visuals
1️⃣ vw_monthly_trend → 1 chart
Type: Line chart

Shows: service_month vs total_services

Answers: “How is service volume changing over time?”

2️⃣ vw_department_trend → 1 chart
Type: Bar / Column chart

Shows: department vs total_services

Answers: “Which departments generate the most service requests?”

3️⃣ vw_high_risk_assets → 1 visual
Type: Table or Bar chart (Top 10–20)

Shows: asset_id + service_count

Answers: “Which assets are the most problematic?”

✅ So total = 3 visuals (charts/tables)
You can lay them out like this:

Page 1: Overview
📈 Line chart: Monthly trend

📊 Bar chart: Department trend

Page 2: Asset Risk
📋 Table or Bar chart: High-risk assets

🧠 Interview-friendly phrasing
“With the three analytical views, I built three core visuals: a monthly trend line chart, a department-wise service volume bar chart, and a high-risk assets table showing the most frequently serviced assets.”

🚀 If you want more visuals later
You can always:

Add filters (by department, date)

Add KPIs cards (total services, total assets)

Add cost or downtime charts (if we add views)

But with your current views:

👉 3 core visuals is the correct and honest answer.

If you want, I can sketch the exact Power BI layout for you (what goes top, left, right, etc.).


You said:
i feel just 3 visuals are not enough

ChatGPT said:
You’re absolutely right — 3 visuals feels too thin for a “real” dashboard 🙂
Good instinct. A dashboard should tell a story, not just show three charts.

The good news: you don’t need new data to make it feel rich and professional. You can layer KPIs + a few extra breakdowns on top of what you already have.

🧱 What you already have (base)
From your 3 views you already get:

📈 Monthly trend (line chart)

📊 Department trend (bar chart)

🚨 High-risk assets (table/bar)

That’s the core. Now let’s make it dashboard-worthy.

🚀 Make it feel like a real dashboard (6–8 visuals)
✅ Add KPI Cards (very important for managers)
You can add these using simple SQL or Power BI measures:

🧮 Total Services (big number card)

🏭 Total Assets (big number card)

⚠️ Top Asset Service Count (max service_count from high-risk view)

Now your dashboard already has 6 visuals:

3 charts

3 KPI cards

📊 Add 1–2 smarter breakdowns (still simple)
Using the same data:

📉 Top 10 Assets Bar Chart

From vw_high_risk_assets

Filter: Top 10 by service_count

Much more visual than just a table

📊 Department Share (%)

Same vw_department_trend

Show as:

Pie / donut chart

Or stacked bar

Answers: “Which departments consume most maintenance?”

🖼️ Final realistic layout (example)
Page 1: Overview
KPI Card: Total Services

KPI Card: Total Assets

KPI Card: Highest Asset Service Count

Line Chart: Monthly Service Trend

Bar Chart: Services by Department

Donut/Pie: Department Share of Services

Page 2: Asset Risk
Bar Chart: Top 10 High-Risk Assets

Table: Asset ID + Service Count (Top 20)

👉 That’s 7–8 visuals without changing your data model.

🧠 Why this looks “professional”
Because now your dashboard:

Starts with summary KPIs (exec-friendly)

Shows trends over time

Shows where the workload comes from

Shows which assets are risky

Supports both overview and drill-down

This is exactly how real ops / analytics dashboards are structured.

🧑‍💼 Interview-safe line
“I started with three core analytical views, then built a dashboard with KPI cards, trend charts, department distribution, and a top-assets risk view. This gives both a high-level operational overview and a focused risk analysis of problematic assets.”

🎯 Bottom line
Your feeling is correct ✅

3 visuals = too basic ❌

With the same data, you can easily build 7–8 solid visuals ✅

No need to overcomplicate SQL or pipeline

If you want, tell me:
👉 Do you want this to look more like a management dashboard or a technical ops/reliability dashboard? I can tailor the exact visuals for that.


You said:
do i need to add more views ?

ChatGPT said:
Great question — and the honest, practical answer is:

👉 No, you do NOT need to add more views to build a good dashboard.
But 👉 Yes, adding 1–2 more views can make your project much stronger.

Let me explain both sides so you can decide smartly.

✅ You can already build a solid dashboard with current 3 views
With:

vw_monthly_trend

vw_department_trend

vw_high_risk_assets

You can build:

KPI cards (total services, total assets, top asset count)

Trend chart (monthly)

Department bar/pie chart

Top assets bar + table

That’s already 6–8 visuals in Power BI using:

The same views

Simple measures / filters

No new SQL needed

So not mandatory to add more views.

🚀 When should you add more views?
Add more views if you want to show:

💰 Cost impact (very business-relevant)

⏱️ Time to close / downtime (very ops-relevant)

🔧 Job type mix (preventive vs corrective)

These make your project look:

More “enterprise”

More analytical

More decision-oriented

🎯 The 2 BEST extra views (if you add any)
If you add just two, I’d recommend:

1️⃣ Cost by department or asset
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_cost_by_department AS
SELECT department, SUM(total_cost) AS total_cost
FROM service_events
GROUP BY department;
Answers:

“Which departments cost us the most in maintenance?”

2️⃣ Average resolution time
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_avg_resolution_time AS
SELECT
  service_month,
  AVG(DATEDIFF('day', opened_at, closed_at)) AS avg_days_to_close
FROM service_events
WHERE closed_at IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY service_month;
Answers:

“Are we getting faster or slower at fixing issues?”

🧑‍💼 Interview-safe answer
“The three core views are enough for a workload and risk overview dashboard. I can also extend it with cost and resolution-time views to make it more decision-focused, but I kept the base version simple and clean.”

✅ My recommendation for you
First: Finish the dashboard using the 3 views ✅

Make it look clean and professional ✅

Then (optional, but strong): Add 1–2 extra views for cost or time 🚀

This keeps your project:

Not overcomplicated

But still impressive and realistic

If you want, tell me what kind of roles you’re targeting (Ops Analyst, Data Analyst, RevOps, etc.), and I’ll tell you exactly whether adding more views is worth it for your profile.


You said:
which one to add

ChatGPT said:
If you’re adding just one extra view, add Cost impact first. It makes the dashboard feel “real” to managers because it answers “Where are we spending money?” (not just “how many repairs happened”).

✅ Add this view: Cost by Department
Question it answers

Which department is costing the most in maintenance?

Where should we focus cost control / preventive maintenance?

SQL

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_cost_by_department AS
SELECT
  department,
  SUM(COALESCE(total_cost, 0)) AS total_cost,
  AVG(COALESCE(total_cost, 0)) AS avg_cost_per_service,
  COUNT(*) AS total_services
FROM service_events
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY total_cost DESC;
Power BI visuals you can add

Bar chart: department vs total_cost

KPI card: total_cost (overall)

Table: department + total_cost + avg_cost_per_service + total_services

If you add a second view later (best next)
Add Average time to close (resolution time) — it’s the best “operations efficiency” KPI.

But for your first upgrade: Cost by Department is the highest impact and easiest to explain.


You said:
should i add or not , if i dont add one more view , will my dashboard look gneric and not impactful

ChatGPT said:
This is a really honest and smart concern 👍
Let me give you a straight, practical answer—not a “theory” one.

🟢 Short answer
No, your dashboard will NOT look bad or useless with just the 3 views.
But…
Yes, adding 1 more view (cost) will make it noticeably more impactful and less generic.

🧠 What happens if you keep only 3 views?
Your dashboard will show:

📈 Trend over time

🏢 Distribution by department

🚨 Problematic assets

That’s:

A workload & risk overview dashboard

Clean, correct, and totally acceptable for:

Entry-level roles

First portfolio project

SQL + BI demonstration

But it will feel:

A bit descriptive (what happened)

Less decision-oriented (what should we do?)

Not “bad”. Just basic.

🚀 What changes if you add just 1 more view (Cost)?
If you add Cost by Department:

Now your dashboard answers:

“Where is the workload?” ✅

“Which assets are risky?” ✅

“Where is the money going?” 💰 ✅

That single addition:

Makes it business-impactful

Makes it feel less generic

Makes it feel more managerial

Shows you think in value & cost, not just counts

🧑‍💼 Recruiter / interviewer psychology (important)
Most interviewers think like this:

Many juniors can show:

Trends

Counts

Bar charts

Fewer juniors think to show:

Cost impact

Business prioritization

So adding one cost view is a signal of maturity, not complexity.

🧾 My honest recommendation for you
If you want the fastest, simplest, safe project →
👉 You can stop at 3 views and it’s still good.

If you want the dashboard to feel less generic and more impressive →
👉 Add 1 view: Cost by Department (and 1–2 visuals from it).

It’s a small effort, big upgrade.

🎯 Final answer
Your dashboard won’t be bad or rejected with 3 views.
But adding just one cost view will make it more impactful, more business-focused, and less generic.

If you want, I can help you decide based on the exact roles you’re applying for (Ops Analyst, Data Analyst, RevOps, etc.) and tune this perfectly for that.


You said:
Add this view: Cost by Department

ChatGPT said:
Perfect choice 👍 This is the best single upgrade you can make to your dashboard.

Here’s exactly what to add in Snowflake.

✅ Step: Create the “Cost by Department” view
Run this in your Snowflake SQL worksheet:

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_cost_by_department AS
SELECT
  department,
  SUM(COALESCE(total_cost, 0)) AS total_cost,
  AVG(COALESCE(total_cost, 0)) AS avg_cost_per_service,
  COUNT(*) AS total_services
FROM service_events
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY total_cost DESC;
🧠 What this view answers (in business terms)
💰 Which departments cost the most in maintenance?

📊 Which departments have the highest average cost per service?

🧾 How many services each department generated along with cost impact?

This turns your dashboard from:

“What happened?”
into:
“Where is the money going and where should we focus?”

📊 How to use it in Power BI
From vw_cost_by_department, add:

Bar chart: department vs total_cost

Table (optional): department, total_cost, avg_cost_per_service, total_services

KPI card (optional): Sum of total_cost (overall maintenance spend)

Now your dashboard will have:

Trends (monthly)

Volume by department

High-risk assets

Cost impact by department 💰 ← this is the upgrade

🧑‍💼 Interview-safe line
“In addition to volume and risk views, I added a cost-by-department view to show where maintenance spend is concentrated, which makes the dashboard more decision-oriented for management.”

If you want, next I can suggest exactly where to place this visual on your dashboard layout so it looks clean and professional.

ChatGPT said:
Nice, these are your core KPI queries. Let me translate them into what each one does and how you use them in your project/dashboard.

1️⃣ Total services (work orders)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_services
FROM service_events;
Answers:
👉 “How many total service jobs do we have in the dataset?”

Use in dashboard:

KPI Card: Total Services

2️⃣ Total assets
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT asset_id) AS total_assets
FROM service_events;
Answers:
👉 “How many unique assets are being serviced?”

Use in dashboard:

KPI Card: Total Assets

3️⃣ Top 20 most serviced assets (high-risk)
SELECT asset_id, COUNT(*) AS service_count
FROM service_events
GROUP BY asset_id
ORDER BY service_count DESC
LIMIT 20;
Answers:
👉 “Which assets require service most frequently?”
👉 “Which assets are the highest risk / most problematic?”

Use in dashboard:

Bar chart: Top 10/20 High-Risk Assets

Or Table: Asset ID + Service Count

(This is what your vw_high_risk_assets view is based on.)

4️⃣ Monthly service trend
SELECT service_month, COUNT(*) AS total_services
FROM service_events
GROUP BY service_month
ORDER BY service_month;
Answers:
👉 “How does service volume change over time?”
👉 “Are we seeing an upward or downward trend?”
👉 “Are there peak months?”

Use in dashboard:

Line chart: Service Month vs Total Services

(This is what your vw_monthly_trend view is.)

5️⃣ Department trend
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_services
FROM service_events
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY total_services DESC;
Answers:
👉 “Which departments generate the most service requests?”
👉 “Where is maintenance workload concentrated?”

Use in dashboard:

Bar chart: Department vs Total Services

Or Pie/Donut: Share of services by department

(This is what your vw_department_trend view is.)

🧠 Big picture: What these queries give you
Together, they answer:

📊 How big is the service workload? (Total services, total assets)

📈 Is it increasing or decreasing over time? (Monthly trend)

🏢 Where is the workload coming from? (Department trend)

🚨 Which assets are the biggest problems? (Top serviced assets)

That’s a complete, logical story for an operations dashboard.

🧑‍💼 Interview-ready summary
“I created KPI queries to measure total service volume and asset base, identify high-risk assets by service frequency, analyze monthly service trends, and compare service demand across departments. These form the foundation for the Snowflake views and the Power BI dashboard.”

If you want, I can now help you convert these into KPI cards + charts layout in Power BI step by step.

ChatGPT said:
Perfect, this error is very common and easy to fix 👍
Snowflake is telling you:

❌ It can’t understand the date format in the opened_at column from your CSV.

So the load fails at line 1 where it tries to parse that date.

Let’s fix it step by step.

🧠 Why this is happening
Your CSV probably has dates like one of these:

2021-07-15 08:32:00

07/15/2021 08:32

15-07-2021

or mixed formats

But your table column is:

opened_at DATE,
closed_at DATE
Snowflake’s UI loader expects a very clean date format (usually YYYY-MM-DD).
When it sees something else, it says:

“Date 'opened_at' is not recognized”

✅ Easiest Fix (Recommended): Change columns to TIMESTAMP
1️⃣ In Snowflake, recreate the table like this:
Run this in a worksheet:

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE service_events (
  work_order_id STRING,
  asset_id STRING,
  job_type STRING,
  status STRING,
  opened_at TIMESTAMP,
  closed_at TIMESTAMP,
  department STRING,
  total_cost FLOAT,
  service_month STRING
);
✅ We changed DATE → TIMESTAMP
Snowflake is much more flexible with timestamps.

2️⃣ Try loading the CSV again
Go to Load data into a Table

Choose SERVICE_EVENTS

Select service_events_clean.csv

Keep format = CSV, header = Yes

Click Load

👉 In 90% of cases, this will work immediately.

🛠️ Alternative Fix (If it still fails): Force clean date format in Python
In your Jupyter notebook, before saving CSV, add:

df["opened_at"] = df["opened_at"].dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
df["closed_at"] = df["closed_at"].dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
Then re-save:

df.to_csv(os.path.join(OUT_DIR, "service_events_clean.csv"), index=False)
And keep Snowflake columns as:

opened_at DATE,
closed_at DATE
🎯 Which method should YOU use?
👉 Use the TIMESTAMP method (first one).
It’s:

Simpler

More realistic (keeps time, not just date)

More robust for messy real-world data

More “enterprise-like”

🧑‍💼 Interview-safe explanation
“The raw data had datetime values in mixed formats, so instead of forcing a strict DATE type, I used TIMESTAMP columns in Snowflake to ensure flexible and reliable ingestion of real-world datetime data.”

✅ Summary
❌ Error happens because Snowflake can’t parse your date format

✅ Fix by changing opened_at / closed_at to TIMESTAMP

✅ Reload CSV

✅ Done

If it still errors, paste one sample value from opened_at column (from the CSV), and I’ll give you the exact format Snowflake needs.

how to add this project in resume 

ChatGPT said:
Great question — adding this properly to your resume can seriously boost your profile if it’s framed in a business + impact way (not just “I did a project”).

I’ll give you:

Where to put it

How to title it

Resume-ready bullet points (you can copy)

How to explain it in interviews

✅ 1️⃣ Where to put it on your resume
Add a section like:

Projects or Data Analytics Projects or Analytics & BI Projects

Place it:

After Experience (if you have work ex), or

After Skills (if you’re early-career)

✅ 2️⃣ Project Title (use this or similar)
Service Fleet Performance & Cost Analytics | Python, SQL (Snowflake), Power BI

Or shorter:

Service Fleet Analytics Dashboard | Python, Snowflake, Power BI

✅ 3️⃣ Resume-ready bullet points (ATS-friendly + interview-safe)
Use 4–6 bullets like these (pick the best 4–5):

Service Fleet Performance & Cost Analytics | Python, Snowflake, Power BI

Cleaned and prepared raw fleet service data using Python (pandas), handling missing values, duplicates, and datetime normalization to create analysis-ready datasets.

Designed and loaded structured tables into Snowflake and built SQL views for monthly service trends, department-wise workload, high-risk assets, and maintenance cost analysis.

Developed KPI queries to track total services, asset coverage, service trends over time, and asset-level risk based on service frequency.

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard showing service volume trends, department-wise service distribution, high-risk assets, and cost by department to support operational decision-making.

Implemented a reproducible analytics workflow (Python → Snowflake → Power BI) with documented SQL and dashboards for portfolio demonstration.

If you want a shorter version, use this:

Built an end-to-end service fleet analytics project using Python, Snowflake, and Power BI, covering data cleaning, SQL-based KPI analysis, and dashboarding.

Created analytical views for monthly service trends, department-wise workload, high-risk assets, and maintenance cost by department.

Delivered an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize operational trends, asset risk, and cost drivers for decision support.

✅ 4️⃣ How this looks to recruiters
This shows you can:

✅ Clean real data (Python / pandas)

✅ Work with a cloud data warehouse (Snowflake)

✅ Write analytical SQL (GROUP BY, aggregations, views)

✅ Build business dashboards (Power BI)

✅ Think in KPIs, trends, risk, and cost (not just charts)

That’s exactly what Ops Analyst / Data Analyst / RevOps / BI roles look for.

🧑‍💼 Interview-ready 1-liner
“I built an end-to-end service fleet analytics project where I cleaned raw data in Python, modeled it in Snowflake, created SQL views for trends, risk, and cost, and built a Power BI dashboard to support operational and cost-focused decision-making.”

⚠️ Important: Don’t oversell
Don’t say “production system”

Don’t claim “real company deployment”

Say: project / portfolio / case study / analytics project

That keeps it 100% interview-defensible (which you care about).

🎯 If you want, paste your current resume bullets here and I’ll:
Integrate this project perfectly

Remove weak points

Optimize for ATS + screening calls

Keep it honest and strong for your target roles

when i did - CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE service_events (
  work_order_id STRING,
  asset_id STRING,
  job_type STRING,
  status STRING,
  opened_at TIMESTAMP,
  closed_at TIMESTAMP,
  department STRING,
  total_cost FLOAT,
  service_month STRING
);      and then import service event data it says 

ChatGPT said:
Got it — changing the column to TIMESTAMP was the right idea, but the Snowflake UI loader still can’t parse the timestamp text in your CSV. That means your opened_at values are in a format Snowflake doesn’t recognize automatically (or the CSV has quotes/extra text).

Let’s fix this in the most reliable way.

Step 1 — Inspect ONE value from your CSV (quick check)
Open service_events_clean.csv in Excel / Notepad and look at the opened_at column first row.
It will look like one of these:

15-07-2021 08:32 ✅/❌ (often fails)

07/15/2021 08:32 AM ❌ (often fails)

2021-07-15 08:32:00 ✅ (usually works)

2021-07-15T08:32:00 ✅/❌

2021-07-15 08:32:00+05:30 ❌ (UI loader may fail)

If you tell me 1–2 sample values, I can tailor the exact format.
But you don’t need to wait — do this robust fix:

✅ Best Fix (Recommended): Save timestamps in Snowflake-friendly format from Python
In your Jupyter notebook, right before saving the CSV, force a standard timestamp format:

# Force a standard timestamp format Snowflake can read
df["opened_at"] = df["opened_at"].dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
df["closed_at"] = df["closed_at"].dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

# If closed_at has NaT, keep it blank (optional)
df["closed_at"] = df["closed_at"].fillna("")
Then save again:

df.to_csv(os.path.join(OUT_DIR, "service_events_clean.csv"), index=False)
Now re-upload the regenerated CSV into SERVICE_EVENTS.

✅ Snowflake recognizes: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

✅ Alternative Fix (Even simpler): Convert to DATE only
If you don’t need time, only date (good enough for monthly trends):

In Python:

df["opened_at"] = df["opened_at"].dt.date
df["closed_at"] = df["closed_at"].dt.date
df.to_csv(os.path.join(OUT_DIR, "service_events_clean.csv"), index=False)
And in Snowflake keep:

opened_at DATE,
closed_at DATE
This is the most load-proof method.

✅ Backup Fix (UI settings): Change File Format to match your timestamp
In the load wizard, if you see options like “Timestamp format”, set it to:

YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS

But honestly: Python formatting is more reliable than UI guessing.

Why this happened (simple explanation)
Your timestamps are not in a single standard format, so Snowflake UI loader can’t infer them. By exporting in a standard format from Python, you make the load deterministic.

Do this now (fastest path)
Add the strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S") lines in Python

Re-create the CSV

Upload again

If you paste one sample value from opened_at in your CSV (first 2 rows), I’ll confirm which of the two fixes (TIMESTAMP or DATE) is best for your exact data.


You said:
service events clean
Now interactive!
this is service event data

ChatGPT said:
Thanks for sharing the file — I checked your service_events_clean.csv.
Good news: your dates are already in a clean format:

opened_at: 2023-08-07
closed_at: 2023-08-08 (or blank)
That format (YYYY-MM-DD) is perfect for Snowflake DATE columns.

❗ Why Snowflake is failing
The error says:

Timestamp 'opened_at' is not recognized

This usually happens when Snowflake is trying to read the header row as data.
So it’s trying to parse the text "opened_at" as a timestamp → fails.

In other words:
👉 The loader is not treating the first row as column names.

✅ Easiest Fix (UI)
When you load the CSV:

Click Load data into a Table

Select your table SERVICE_EVENTS

Select service_events_clean.csv

In the File Format / Options step:

✅ Check “First row is header” (or “Skip header = 1”)

File type: CSV

Load again

That should immediately fix the error.

✅ Also fix the table schema (recommended)
Since your file has date only (no time), use DATE instead of TIMESTAMP:

Run this in Snowflake:

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE service_events (
  work_order_id STRING,
  asset_id STRING,
  job_type STRING,
  status STRING,
  opened_at DATE,
  closed_at DATE,
  department STRING,
  total_cost FLOAT,
  service_month STRING
);
Then reload the CSV (with header enabled).

🧪 Why I’m confident this will work
Your file actually looks like this (first rows):

work_order_id,asset_id,job_type,status,opened_at,closed_at,department,total_cost,service_month
2023-3001-1390,60959,REPAIR,OPEN,2023-08-07,,WATER WORKS,239.8,2023-08
...
So:

opened_at = 2023-08-07 ✅ valid DATE

The only reason Snowflake would complain is if it’s trying to parse the header text "opened_at" as data.

🎯 Summary (do this)
Recreate table with DATE columns (SQL above)

Reload CSV

Make sure “First row is header” is ON

If it still errors, tell me exactly what options you see in the load wizard and I’ll guide you click-by-click. 


You said:
Uploaded image

ChatGPT said:
Perfect — this screenshot shows exactly what’s wrong 👍
Snowflake is loading your header row as data.

See this row in the preview?

work_order_id | asset_id | job_type | status | opened_at | closed_at | department

That should NOT be loaded as a data row. Because Snowflake tries to put "opened_at" (the text) into a DATE/TIMESTAMP column, you get this error:

Timestamp 'opened_at' is not recognized

✅ Fix it in the Load UI (2 clicks)
On this same screen:

Click View options (left side under File format)

Find Header / Skip header option

Set it to:

✅ First row is header
or

✅ Skip header = 1

(Wordings vary, but you want Snowflake to ignore the first row.)

Check the Table Preview again:

The first row should now be:

2023-3001-1390 | 60959 | REPAIR | OPEN | 2023-08-07 | 2023-08-08 | WATER WORKS
And NOT work_order_id | asset_id | ...

Click Load

✅ Also make sure your table types are DATE (recommended)
Your CSV dates are like 2023-08-07, so this is perfect:

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE service_events (
  work_order_id STRING,
  asset_id STRING,
  job_type STRING,
  status STRING,
  opened_at DATE,
  closed_at DATE,
  department STRING,
  total_cost FLOAT,
  service_month STRING
);
🧠 Why this fixes it
Before: Snowflake tries to parse the text "opened_at" as a date ❌

After: Snowflake skips the header and only parses real dates like 2023-08-07 ✅

🎯 Quick checklist before clicking Load
File type: CSV ✅

First row is header / Skip header = 1 ✅

Preview first row shows real data, not column names ✅

Do this and the load will work immediately.
If you want, send me the next screenshot after you change the option and I’ll confirm it’s correct before you click Load.

ChatGPT said:
Yep — progress ✅ Now it’s failing on TOTAL_COST because your CSV has values with a thousands comma, like:

1,033.04

Snowflake’s loader is trying to read that as a number, but with the comma it doesn’t recognize it (unless you explicitly set a thousands separator).

You have 2 clean fixes. Pick the easiest one.

✅ Fix 1 (Recommended): Remove commas in Python and re-export CSV
In your Jupyter notebook, add this before to_csv():

# Clean TOTAL_COST: remove thousands commas and convert to numeric
df["total_cost"] = (
    df["total_cost"]
    .astype(str)
    .str.replace(",", "", regex=False)   # "1,033.04" -> "1033.04"
)

df["total_cost"] = pd.to_numeric(df["total_cost"], errors="coerce")
Then save again:

df.to_csv(os.path.join(OUT_DIR, "service_events_clean.csv"), index=False)
Now upload the new CSV to Snowflake again.

✅ This is the most reliable and interview-defensible fix.

✅ Fix 2 (UI-only): Set thousands separator in Snowflake load options
During Load Data, go to View options → file format options, and look for something like:

Thousands separator → set to ,

Decimal separator → set to .

Not all UI versions expose this clearly, so Fix 1 is usually faster.

✅ After fixing, confirm in Snowflake
Run:

SELECT MIN(total_cost), MAX(total_cost), AVG(total_cost)
FROM service_events;
If it returns numbers, you’re done.

Why it happened (1 line)
Your CSV has “human-formatted” numbers with commas; Snowflake expects machine-formatted numeric values unless told otherwise.

If you want, upload your updated service_events_clean.csv again and I’ll quickly confirm total_cost is clean before you re-load.


You said:
for total cost - Warning: Data types do not match.

service_month

SERVICE_MONTH
2023-08, 2023-08, 2023-08, 2023-08, 2023-08

ChatGPT said:
Good, you’re very close now 👍
That “Data types do not match” warning means:

The CSV column type and the Snowflake table column type don’t match exactly.

From your screenshot/text, the warning is actually about service_month, not total_cost.

Your CSV has:

service_month
2023-08
2023-08
2023-08
...
That is a STRING like "2023-08" (year-month), not a DATE.

✅ What your table should look like
Since service_month is just a label like YYYY-MM, keep it as STRING:

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE service_events (
  work_order_id STRING,
  asset_id STRING,
  job_type STRING,
  status STRING,
  opened_at DATE,
  closed_at DATE,
  department STRING,
  total_cost FLOAT,
  service_month STRING
);
🔹 service_month = STRING ✅
🔹 total_cost = FLOAT ✅
🔹 opened_at, closed_at = DATE ✅

✅ If Snowflake still shows a warning
That warning is not fatal. It usually means:

Snowflake is guessing a different type (e.g., DATE) for service_month

But your table column is STRING

You can safely proceed as long as:

Preview shows correct values: 2023-08

total_cost shows numbers like 239.8, 1033.04, etc. (no commas)

🛠️ If you want to make it “perfect” (optional)
You can also recreate service_month as DATE (first day of month):

In Python (optional refinement)
df["service_month"] = pd.to_datetime(df["opened_at"]).dt.to_period("M").dt.to_timestamp()
df.to_csv(os.path.join(OUT_DIR, "service_events_clean.csv"), index=False)
And in Snowflake:
service_month DATE
But this is not required for your dashboard. STRING "2023-08" is totally fine.

🎯 What about total_cost?
You already fixed the main issue (commas).
As long as:

total_cost column preview shows numbers (no quotes, no commas)

Table column is FLOAT

You’re good.

✅ What I recommend you do now
Make sure table schema matches this:

total_cost FLOAT

service_month STRING

In Load UI:

Header = ON / Skip header = 1

Ignore the service_month type warning if it still shows

Click Load

🧪 After load, quickly verify:
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS rows_loaded,
  MIN(total_cost),
  MAX(total_cost)
FROM service_events;
If this runs → 🎉 you’re done.

If you want, paste the exact table DDL you currently have and I’ll sanity-check it line by line before you load again.


You said:
idid not follow the above steps 

ChatGPT said:
No problem — we’ll fix it from where you are right now.

From your last message, you’re seeing a data type mismatch warning (at least for service_month). That usually happens when:

Your Snowflake table column types don’t match what’s in the CSV, OR

The loader is auto-detecting a different type.

Let’s reset cleanly in the simplest, safest way.

✅ Step 1 — Recreate the table with correct types (copy–paste)
Run this in Snowflake (Worksheet):

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE SERVICE_EVENTS (
  WORK_ORDER_ID STRING,
  ASSET_ID STRING,
  JOB_TYPE STRING,
  STATUS STRING,
  OPENED_AT DATE,
  CLOSED_AT DATE,
  DEPARTMENT STRING,
  TOTAL_COST FLOAT,
  SERVICE_MONTH STRING
);
Why these types:

OPENED_AT, CLOSED_AT are like 2023-08-07 → DATE

TOTAL_COST numeric → FLOAT

SERVICE_MONTH like 2023-08 → STRING (not a DATE)

✅ Step 2 — Fix your CSV’s total_cost commas (only if still present)
In Jupyter, run this on your dataframe before saving:

df["total_cost"] = df["total_cost"].astype(str).str.replace(",", "", regex=False)
df["total_cost"] = pd.to_numeric(df["total_cost"], errors="coerce")
df.to_csv(os.path.join(OUT_DIR, "service_events_clean.csv"), index=False)
(If you already did this and saved the file, skip this step.)

✅ Step 3 — Load again (important settings)
When you load in Snowflake UI:

Load data into a Table

Choose FLEET_ANALYTICS.PUBLIC.SERVICE_EVENTS

Select your service_events_clean.csv

Click View options

Set:

✅ First row is header (or Skip header = 1)

File type = CSV

Then click Load.

✅ Step 4 — Verify load success
Run:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SERVICE_EVENTS;
SELECT MIN(TOTAL_COST), MAX(TOTAL_COST) FROM SERVICE_EVENTS;
If you get numbers, you’re done ✅

What you should do right now
Since you said you didn’t follow the earlier steps, do Step 1 first (recreate table), then try loading again with header enabled.

If it still fails, tell me exactly:

Is the error about TOTAL_COST again, or OPENED_AT / SERVICE_MONTH?


You said:
i was here - Error on line 13, character 53, column 8 ("TOTAL_COST")
Numeric value '1,033.04' is not recognized

ChatGPT said:
Got it — you’re stuck on TOTAL_COST because your CSV contains values like 1,033.04 (comma as thousands separator). Snowflake can’t load that into a numeric column unless you clean it or set a thousands separator.

✅ Best fix (recommended): Clean TOTAL_COST in Jupyter and re-export
In your Jupyter notebook, run this before saving service_events_clean.csv:

# Remove thousands commas and convert total_cost to numeric
df["total_cost"] = (
    df["total_cost"]
    .astype(str)
    .str.replace(",", "", regex=False)  # "1,033.04" -> "1033.04"
)

df["total_cost"] = pd.to_numeric(df["total_cost"], errors="coerce")

# Save again (overwrite the file)
df.to_csv(os.path.join(OUT_DIR, "service_events_clean.csv"), index=False)
print("✅ Re-saved service_events_clean.csv with cleaned total_cost")
Then go back to Snowflake and load the CSV again.

✅ Make sure your Snowflake column type is numeric
Your table should have:

TOTAL_COST FLOAT
(Or NUMBER — FLOAT is fine.)

Quick check (optional but useful)
After cleaning, check if any values still have commas:

(df["total_cost"].astype(str).str.contains(",")).sum()
It should print 0.

Why this works
Snowflake expects machine-formatted numbers like 1033.04. The comma makes it look like text.

If you want, upload your updated service_events_clean.csv again here and I’ll verify in 2 seconds that the commas are gone before you reload.


You said:
other option

ChatGPT said:
Yep — you have two solid “non-Python” options.

Option 1 (Best non-Python): Load TOTAL_COST as TEXT first, then convert in Snowflake
This avoids loader failing on 1,033.04.

Step A — Create a raw table where total_cost is STRING
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE service_events_raw (
  work_order_id STRING,
  asset_id STRING,
  job_type STRING,
  status STRING,
  opened_at DATE,
  closed_at DATE,
  department STRING,
  total_cost_str STRING,   -- 👈 string on purpose
  service_month STRING
);
Step B — Load your CSV into SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW (it will succeed)
Use Load data into a Table → choose SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW.

Step C — Create the final clean table by converting the string to number
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE service_events AS
SELECT
  work_order_id,
  asset_id,
  job_type,
  status,
  opened_at,
  closed_at,
  department,
  TRY_TO_DOUBLE(REPLACE(total_cost_str, ',', '')) AS total_cost,  -- 👈 convert safely
  service_month
FROM service_events_raw;
✅ TRY_TO_DOUBLE won’t crash; if any weird value exists it becomes NULL instead of failing.

Verify
SELECT COUNT(*), MIN(total_cost), MAX(total_cost)
FROM service_events;
Option 2: Set a file format in Snowflake with thousands separator (UI/SQL)
Some Snowflake loaders can handle thousands separators if the file format is configured.

Create a file format
CREATE OR REPLACE FILE FORMAT ff_fleet_csv
  TYPE = CSV
  SKIP_HEADER = 1
  FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY = '"'
  TRIM_SPACE = TRUE
  NULL_IF = ('', 'NULL', 'null');
Then, in the Load screen, choose that file format (if the UI lets you pick an existing format).

⚠️ Note: the “thousands separator” setting isn’t always exposed cleanly in the UI for table-load wizard. That’s why Option 1 is more reliable.

What I recommend as your “other option”
👉 Option 1 (RAW table → convert)

Because it’s:

100% reliable even with messy numeric formats

Very “real-world” (raw → curated pattern)

Easy to explain in interviews

If you tell me whether you want to keep the final table name as SERVICE_EVENTS (same as before) or are okay with SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW + SERVICE_EVENTS, I’ll align the exact SQL so it doesn’t break your views.


You said:
after step b it was loaded in service events raw , what to do next

ChatGPT said:
Great — once it’s loaded into SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW, you’re at the best point. Now you’ll convert it into your final clean table SERVICE_EVENTS by removing the commas and casting to a number.

✅ Next: Create the final clean SERVICE_EVENTS table
Run this in Snowflake:

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE SERVICE_EVENTS AS
SELECT
  WORK_ORDER_ID,
  ASSET_ID,
  JOB_TYPE,
  STATUS,
  OPENED_AT,
  CLOSED_AT,
  DEPARTMENT,
  TRY_TO_DOUBLE(REPLACE(TOTAL_COST_STR, ',', '')) AS TOTAL_COST,
  SERVICE_MONTH
FROM SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW;
Why this works
REPLACE(..., ',', '') turns 1,033.04 → 1033.04

TRY_TO_DOUBLE(...) converts to number safely (bad values become NULL instead of failing)

✅ Verify the conversion worked
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS rows_loaded,
  COUNT_IF(TOTAL_COST IS NULL) AS null_cost_rows,
  MIN(TOTAL_COST) AS min_cost,
  MAX(TOTAL_COST) AS max_cost
FROM SERVICE_EVENTS;
If rows_loaded looks correct and max_cost is a normal number, you’re good.

✅ Now recreate (or keep) your views on the clean table
Re-run your views so they reference SERVICE_EVENTS (the clean one):

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_monthly_trend AS
SELECT service_month, COUNT(*) AS total_services
FROM service_events
GROUP BY service_month;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_high_risk_assets AS
SELECT asset_id, COUNT(*) AS service_count
FROM service_events
GROUP BY asset_id;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_department_trend AS
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_services
FROM service_events
GROUP BY department;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_cost_by_department AS
SELECT
  department,
  SUM(COALESCE(total_cost, 0)) AS total_cost,
  AVG(COALESCE(total_cost, 0)) AS avg_cost_per_service,
  COUNT(*) AS total_services
FROM service_events
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY total_cost DESC;
✅ Optional cleanup
If everything looks good, you can keep SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW (good for audit) or drop it:

-- DROP TABLE SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW;
If you run into any error on the CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE SERVICE_EVENTS AS ..., paste the exact error text and I’ll fix it immediately.


You said:
but if the csv is loaded in service events raw , what it has to do with service events

ChatGPT said:
Great question — think of it like this:

✅ SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW = staging / raw landing table
It holds the CSV exactly as it came, including “dirty” values like:

TOTAL_COST_STR = '1,033.04' (comma problem)

sometimes messy blanks, text, etc.

You load into RAW first because Snowflake won’t accept dirty values into numeric/date columns.

✅ SERVICE_EVENTS = clean / final analytics table
This is the table you actually use for:

KPI SQL

Views

Power BI dashboard

So we create SERVICE_EVENTS from SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW by cleaning and converting types.

🧠 What “connection” is there between them?
The connection is this SQL transformation:

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE SERVICE_EVENTS AS
SELECT
  ...,
  TRY_TO_DOUBLE(REPLACE(TOTAL_COST_STR, ',', '')) AS TOTAL_COST,
  ...
FROM SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW;
Meaning:

Read rows from SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW

Fix the comma in cost

Convert it to a real number

Save the cleaned result into SERVICE_EVENTS

So:

✅ RAW table is just input
✅ Final table is your usable dataset

Simple real-world analogy
SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW = you received invoices as scanned PDFs / messy Excel

SERVICE_EVENTS = you cleaned them and entered into the system properly

You don’t run analytics on messy inputs — you run analytics on clean curated tables.

Why we don’t just use RAW for everything
Because in RAW:

TOTAL_COST_STR is text

You can’t reliably SUM/AVG it

Power BI visuals can break

KPIs become inaccurate

In CLEAN (SERVICE_EVENTS):

TOTAL_COST is numeric

You can do SUM/AVG safely

Your dashboard works perfectly

Final answer
You loaded CSV into SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW only to get the data into Snowflake without errors.
Then you create SERVICE_EVENTS from it as your clean analytics-ready table.

If you want, I can show you the exact query to confirm the difference in types between the two tables.


You said:
what to do  afterthis

ChatGPT said:
You’re at the point where RAW is loaded. Now you do 3 steps to finish the pipeline and get to Power BI.

✅ Step 1 — Create the final clean table from RAW
Run this (adjust the TOTAL_COST column name if yours is slightly different):

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE SERVICE_EVENTS AS
SELECT
  WORK_ORDER_ID,
  ASSET_ID,
  JOB_TYPE,
  STATUS,
  OPENED_AT,
  CLOSED_AT,
  DEPARTMENT,
  TRY_TO_DOUBLE(REPLACE(TOTAL_COST_STR, ',', '')) AS TOTAL_COST,
  SERVICE_MONTH
FROM SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW;
If your RAW table column is TOTAL_COST (not TOTAL_COST_STR), use:

TRY_TO_DOUBLE(REPLACE(TOTAL_COST, ',', '')) AS TOTAL_COST
✅ Step 2 — Verify it worked
SELECT COUNT(*) AS rows_loaded FROM SERVICE_EVENTS;

SELECT
  MIN(TOTAL_COST) AS min_cost,
  MAX(TOTAL_COST) AS max_cost,
  COUNT_IF(TOTAL_COST IS NULL) AS null_cost_rows
FROM SERVICE_EVENTS;
If rows_loaded looks right and max_cost is a normal number → ✅ done.

✅ Step 3 — Create / re-create your views (used by Power BI)
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_monthly_trend AS
SELECT service_month, COUNT(*) AS total_services
FROM service_events
GROUP BY service_month;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_high_risk_assets AS
SELECT asset_id, COUNT(*) AS service_count
FROM service_events
GROUP BY asset_id;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_department_trend AS
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_services
FROM service_events
GROUP BY department;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_cost_by_department AS
SELECT
  department,
  SUM(COALESCE(total_cost, 0)) AS total_cost,
  AVG(COALESCE(total_cost, 0)) AS avg_cost_per_service,
  COUNT(*) AS total_services
FROM service_events
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY total_cost DESC;
Then: Power BI
In Power BI → Get Data → Snowflake → load these views:

vw_monthly_trend

vw_department_trend

vw_high_risk_assets

vw_cost_by_department

Quick question (so I don’t mislead you):
In your SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW table, what is the exact column name for cost?
Is it TOTAL_COST_STR or TOTAL_COST?


You said:

SERVICE\_EVENTS

it should be service_events

ChatGPT said:
Got it — you want the final usable table to be SERVICE_EVENTS (not SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW). That’s exactly the right approach.

Here’s what to do now, assuming your CSV is already loaded into SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW.

✅ Step 1 — Create/replace SERVICE_EVENTS from SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW
If RAW has the cost column as TOTAL_COST_STR
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE SERVICE_EVENTS AS
SELECT
  WORK_ORDER_ID,
  ASSET_ID,
  JOB_TYPE,
  STATUS,
  OPENED_AT,
  CLOSED_AT,
  DEPARTMENT,
  TRY_TO_DOUBLE(REPLACE(TOTAL_COST_STR, ',', '')) AS TOTAL_COST,
  SERVICE_MONTH
FROM SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW;
If RAW has the cost column as TOTAL_COST
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE SERVICE_EVENTS AS
SELECT
  WORK_ORDER_ID,
  ASSET_ID,
  JOB_TYPE,
  STATUS,
  OPENED_AT,
  CLOSED_AT,
  DEPARTMENT,
  TRY_TO_DOUBLE(REPLACE(TOTAL_COST, ',', '')) AS TOTAL_COST,
  SERVICE_MONTH
FROM SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW;
✅ Step 2 — Verify SERVICE_EVENTS is correct
SELECT COUNT(*) AS rows_loaded
FROM SERVICE_EVENTS;

SELECT
  MIN(TOTAL_COST) AS min_cost,
  MAX(TOTAL_COST) AS max_cost,
  COUNT_IF(TOTAL_COST IS NULL) AS null_cost_rows
FROM SERVICE_EVENTS;
✅ Step 3 — Point your views to SERVICE_EVENTS
Re-run your views so they use the clean table:

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_monthly_trend AS
SELECT service_month, COUNT(*) AS total_services
FROM service_events
GROUP BY service_month;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_high_risk_assets AS
SELECT asset_id, COUNT(*) AS service_count
FROM service_events
GROUP BY asset_id;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_department_trend AS
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS total_services
FROM service_events
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY total_services DESC;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_cost_by_department AS
SELECT
  department,
  SUM(COALESCE(total_cost, 0)) AS total_cost,
  AVG(COALESCE(total_cost, 0)) AS avg_cost_per_service,
  COUNT(*) AS total_services
FROM service_events
GROUP BY department
ORDER BY total_cost DESC;
✅ Optional (after everything works)
You can keep SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW for audit, or delete it:

-- DROP TABLE SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW;
One tiny thing I need you to do (no guessing)
Run this to confirm the exact cost column name in RAW:

DESC TABLE SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW;
Then tell me whether it shows TOTAL_COST_STR or TOTAL_COST — and I’ll tell you which of the two Step 1 queries to run.

  service_month
FROM service_events_raw;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS rows_loaded
FROM service_events;           

ChatGPT said:
You’re basically correct ✅ — but there’s one critical issue in your script:

❌ You created SERVICE_EVENTS twice
First as an empty table with total_cost FLOAT

Then again as a CTAS (CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE service_events AS SELECT ... FROM service_events_raw;)

That’s fine (Snowflake will replace it), but only if the raw load went into SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW successfully and the columns match.

What you should do now (clean, correct order)
✅ 1) Make sure you loaded the CSV into SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW (not SERVICE_EVENTS)
If you loaded into SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW, great.

Now run this to confirm data is there:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM service_events_raw;
If this returns 0, you loaded into the wrong table.

✅ 2) Recreate final SERVICE_EVENTS from RAW (your CTAS is correct)
Your conversion query is correct:

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE service_events AS
SELECT
  work_order_id,
  asset_id,
  job_type,
  status,
  opened_at,
  closed_at,
  department,
  TRY_TO_DOUBLE(REPLACE(total_cost_str, ',', '')) AS total_cost,
  service_month
FROM service_events_raw;
✅ 3) Verify final table has numeric cost
Run:

SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS rows_loaded,
  COUNT_IF(total_cost IS NULL) AS null_cost_rows,
  MIN(total_cost) AS min_cost,
  MAX(total_cost) AS max_cost
FROM service_events;
rows_loaded should match raw rows

max_cost should look like a normal number (e.g., 1033.04)

null_cost_rows should be small (or 0)

Important note: you don’t need the first service_events empty DDL anymore
To avoid confusion, the clean approach is:

Keep SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW

Build SERVICE_EVENTS only from RAW (CTAS)

So you can delete this part in future runs:

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE service_events (...);
Because CTAS will create the table automatically.

Final checklist (do these 3 queries now)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM service_events_raw;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM service_events;
SELECT COUNT_IF(total_cost IS NULL) FROM service_events;
If you paste the results, I’ll tell you immediately if everything is correct and you’re ready to create views + connect Power BI.

You said:
if is delete the worksheet will the database be deleted , i want to start the snowflake part over 

ChatGPT said:
Great question — and don’t worry, Snowflake does NOT work like Excel or Jupyter 🙂

❌ Deleting a worksheet does NOT delete:
Your database

Your schemas

Your tables

Your views

Your data

A worksheet is just a query editor (like a Notepad for SQL).
Deleting it only deletes the text of the queries, not the objects in Snowflake.

✅ If you want to start the Snowflake part over (clean reset)
You have two safe options:

🔁 Option 1: Drop and recreate the database (cleanest)
Run this in any worksheet:

DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS FLEET_ANALYTICS;

CREATE DATABASE FLEET_ANALYTICS;
USE DATABASE FLEET_ANALYTICS;

CREATE SCHEMA PUBLIC;
USE SCHEMA PUBLIC;
This will:

❌ Delete all tables, views, data in FLEET_ANALYTICS

✅ Give you a fresh empty database

✅ Let you re-run the full script from scratch

Then you can re-run the full end-to-end SQL flow I gave you.

🧹 Option 2: Only drop specific tables/views (if you want partial reset)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS SERVICE_EVENTS;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ASSETS;

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS VW_MONTHLY_TREND;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS VW_HIGH_RISK_ASSETS;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS VW_DEPARTMENT_TREND;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS VW_COST_BY_DEPARTMENT;
Then re-run the create statements.

🧠 Key concept (important for you to remember)
Worksheets = just editors ✍️

Databases / Tables = real objects 🗄️

Deleting one does not affect the other

🎯 What I recommend you do
Since you said “I want to start the Snowflake part over”:

👉 Run Option 1 (DROP DATABASE + recreate)
Then paste and run the full script I gave you from top to bottom.

If you want, tell me when you’ve dropped the database and I’ll walk you step-by-step through the reload so nothing breaks this time.


You said:
done with the snowflake part , how to save

ChatGPT said:
Nice, that’s a big milestone 🎉
Let’s make sure your Snowflake work is safely “saved” and portfolio-ready.

First, an important truth:

✅ In Snowflake, your database, tables, and views are already saved on Snowflake’s servers.
❌ There is no “Save Project” button like in Excel.

What you do need to save is:

Your SQL scripts

Your proof (screenshots)

Your Power BI file (next step)

And put them in GitHub / local folder

✅ 1) Are your Snowflake objects already saved?
Yes. If you can run:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SERVICE_EVENTS;
and it returns a number, then:

Your tables exist ✅

Your data exists ✅

Your views exist ✅

It’s already “saved” in Snowflake ✅

Deleting a worksheet will NOT delete these.

✅ 2) Save your SQL (very important for portfolio)
In Snowflake:

Open your worksheet(s) where you ran:

Create tables

Create views

KPI queries

Click … (three dots) or File → Download / Export

Save as:

sql/01_create_tables.sql

sql/02_create_views.sql

sql/03_kpi_queries.sql

Or simply:

Copy–paste the SQL into .sql files in your project folder.

Your project folder should look like:

service-fleet-analytics/
  sql/
    01_create_tables.sql
    02_create_views.sql
    03_kpi_queries.sql
  notebooks/
  data_clean/
  screenshots/
  powerbi/
✅ 3) Take screenshots (proof for GitHub & resume)
Use Snipping Tool / Screenshot:

Take screenshots of:

Snowflake tables list (ASSETS, SERVICE_EVENTS, views)

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SERVICE_EVENTS; result

One view query result (e.g., VW_COST_BY_DEPARTMENT)

Optional: Schema overview

Save them in:

screenshots/
  snowflake_tables.png
  service_events_count.png
  cost_by_department_view.png
✅ 4) What about Power BI?
Next step (we’ll do this after):

Build dashboard in Power BI

Save file as:

powerbi/fleet_dashboard.pbix
That file is your main visual asset.

✅ 5) What about Snowflake trial expiry?
Even if Snowflake expires later:

You still have:

Python cleaning code ✅

SQL scripts ✅

Screenshots ✅

Power BI file ✅

You can recreate everything in 30 minutes using your saved SQL.

That’s exactly how a reproducible portfolio project should be.

🧠 Simple answer to “how to save?”
Snowflake data is already saved automatically ✅

You should export your SQL + take screenshots + save PBIX ✅

Put everything in your project folder / GitHub ✅

🎯 What I suggest you do now
Export / copy your SQL into .sql files

Take 3–4 screenshots of Snowflake results

Tell me: “Done”

Then we move to Power BI dashboard step-by-step 🚀


You said:
should i just copy the code , go to notepad and then save as . sql

ChatGPT said:
Yes — that’s exactly what you should do 👍
That’s the normal, professional way to save SQL for a project.

Here’s the simple, safe way:

✅ Step-by-step
Open Notepad (or VS Code, or any text editor)

Copy your SQL from Snowflake (for example):

Create tables

Create views

KPI queries

Paste into Notepad

Click File → Save As

In File name, type something like:

01_create_tables.sql
In Save as type, choose:

All Files (*.*)
Make sure it does NOT become:

01_create_tables.sql.txt
Save it inside your project folder, for example:

service-fleet-analytics/sql/01_create_tables.sql
📁 Good file structure (recommended)
You can create these files:

sql/01_create_tables.sql → DB, schema, tables (ASSETS, SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW, SERVICE_EVENTS)

sql/02_create_views.sql → All your CREATE VIEW statements

sql/03_kpi_queries.sql → Your SELECT KPI queries

🧠 How to check it’s saved correctly
The file icon should not be a text file icon

When you open it, it should open in a code editor or show SQL

The filename should end with .sql (not .txt)

💡 Why this is important
This makes your project:

Reproducible ✅

Professional ✅

GitHub-ready ✅

Interview-proof ✅

🎯 Short answer
Yes. Copy the code → paste in Notepad → Save As → something.sql (All Files) → Done.

If you want, tell me what files you’ve created and I’ll suggest exact names for each so your project looks super clean and organized.


You said:
i will create the power bi dashboard later , how to upload the progress till now to github

ChatGPT said:
Perfect — this is exactly the right time to push your work to GitHub 👍
You don’t need Power BI yet. You can upload Python + SQL + screenshots + structure now and add Power BI later.

I’ll give you two easy ways. Pick whichever you like:

✅ Option A: Easiest (GitHub website, no commands)
1️⃣ Create a repo on GitHub
Go to github.com

Click New repository

Name it something like:

service-fleet-analytics
Set:

Public (recommended for portfolio)

✅ Add README (optional, we can edit later)

Click Create repository

2️⃣ Prepare your local project folder
Your folder should look like this (example):

service-fleet-analytics/
  notebooks/
    01_clean.ipynb
  data_clean/
    service_events_clean.csv
    assets_clean.csv
  sql/
    01_create_tables.sql
    02_create_views.sql
    03_kpi_queries.sql
  screenshots/
    snowflake_tables.png
    service_events_count.png
If you don’t have some folders yet, that’s okay. Upload whatever you have now.

3️⃣ Upload via GitHub web UI
Open your repo on GitHub

Click Add file → Upload files

Drag and drop:

notebooks/

sql/

data_clean/ (optional, you can include or exclude CSVs)

screenshots/

Scroll down → Write a message like:

Initial commit: data cleaning + Snowflake SQL setup
Click Commit changes

✅ Done. Your progress is now saved online.

✅ Option B: Using GitHub Desktop (also easy)
If you want a cleaner workflow:

Install GitHub Desktop

Clone your repo:

File → Clone repository → Choose your new repo

Copy your project files into the cloned folder

Open GitHub Desktop:

It will show changed files

Write commit message:

Add data cleaning notebook and Snowflake SQL scripts
Click Commit

Click Push

🧠 What you SHOULD upload now
Upload:

✅ notebooks/01_clean.ipynb

✅ sql/*.sql

✅ screenshots/

✅ README.md (even a simple one is fine)

Optional:

data_clean/*.csv (you can include or exclude; for portfolios it’s okay to include if not huge)

📝 Simple README you can paste (for now)
Create README.md and paste this:

# Service Fleet Analytics

End-to-end analytics project using Python, Snowflake, and Power BI.

## Current Progress
- Cleaned raw fleet service data using Python (pandas)
- Created Snowflake tables and views for:
  - Monthly service trends
  - Department-wise service volume
  - High-risk assets
  - Cost by department
- Saved SQL scripts and screenshots for reproducibility

## Tech Stack
- Python (pandas)
- Snowflake (SQL)
- Power BI (dashboard to be added)

## Project Structure
- notebooks/ → Data cleaning in Python
- sql/ → Snowflake DDL, views, and KPI queries
- screenshots/ → Proof of Snowflake setup and results
You can improve this later — this is totally fine for now.

🎯 Short answer
Yes: create a GitHub repo → upload your folders/files → commit → done.
Your Snowflake work is now safe, shareable, and portfolio-ready.

If you want, tell me:

Are you using GitHub web or GitHub Desktop?
I can guide you click-by-click for your exact screen.


You said:
what screenshots do i need 

ChatGPT said:
Great question — good screenshots = proof your project is real 👍
You don’t need many. 5–7 clear screenshots are perfect.

Here’s the exact list I recommend (in priority order):

✅ 1) Snowflake Tables & Views list (Very important)
What to screenshot:

Your database/schema showing:

ASSETS

SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW

SERVICE_EVENTS

Views:

VW_MONTHLY_TREND

VW_HIGH_RISK_ASSETS

VW_DEPARTMENT_TREND

VW_COST_BY_DEPARTMENT

Why:

Proves you created the data model and views

Shows structure, not just results

File name:

screenshots/snowflake_objects.png
✅ 2) Row count in final table
Run:

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SERVICE_EVENTS;
Screenshot the result.

Why:

Proves data is actually loaded

Shows scale of data

File name:

screenshots/service_events_count.png
✅ 3) Cost conversion worked
Run:

SELECT
  MIN(TOTAL_COST),
  MAX(TOTAL_COST),
  COUNT_IF(TOTAL_COST IS NULL)
FROM SERVICE_EVENTS;
Screenshot the result.

Why:

Proves you fixed the "1,033.04" problem

Shows numeric data is clean and usable

File name:

screenshots/total_cost_check.png
✅ 4) One KPI query result (e.g., Monthly Trend)
Run:

SELECT * FROM VW_MONTHLY_TREND ORDER BY SERVICE_MONTH;
Screenshot the result table.

Why:

Shows your analytical output

This is what Power BI will consume

File name:

screenshots/vw_monthly_trend_result.png
✅ 5) Cost by Department view result (Your “upgrade” view)
Run:

SELECT * FROM VW_COST_BY_DEPARTMENT;
Screenshot the result.

Why:

Shows business impact (money 💰)

Makes your project look more “decision-oriented”

File name:

screenshots/vw_cost_by_department_result.png
✅ 6) (Optional but nice) SQL script open in worksheet
Open your worksheet showing:

CREATE TABLE

CREATE VIEW statements

Screenshot it.

Why:

Shows you actually wrote SQL

Nice proof for GitHub & interviews

File name:

screenshots/sql_setup.png
🗂️ Final screenshots/ folder example
screenshots/
  snowflake_objects.png
  service_events_count.png
  total_cost_check.png
  vw_monthly_trend_result.png
  vw_cost_by_department_result.png
  sql_setup.png
🧠 Important tips
Keep screenshots clear and readable

Crop unnecessary UI clutter

Make sure table/view names and numbers are visible

Don’t worry about perfection — clarity > beauty

🎯 Short answer
You need screenshots that prove:

Tables & views exist ✅

Data is loaded ✅

Numbers are clean ✅

Views return results ✅

If you want, after you take them you can tell me what you captured and I’ll confirm if your set is portfolio-perfect or if one more is worth adding.


You said:
cant screeshot sql setup , script is big

ChatGPT said:
Totally fine 🙂 You don’t need a full SQL-setup screenshot if the script is big. That’s very normal.

For a portfolio, your .sql files in GitHub are the real proof. Screenshots are just visual support.

Here are your best options (pick one):

✅ Option 1 (Best & simplest): Don’t screenshot the SQL at all
Just:

Save your SQL as:

sql/01_create_tables.sql

sql/02_create_views.sql

sql/03_kpi_queries.sql

Upload these files to GitHub

In your README you can write:

“Full Snowflake DDL and views are available in the sql/ folder.”

That’s 100% professional and normal.
Recruiters prefer actual code files over screenshots anyway.

✅ Option 2: Screenshot only a small part (if you really want one)
If you still want a visual:

Scroll to just the top part (e.g., CREATE DATABASE / CREATE TABLE)

Take 1 small screenshot

Or take 2–3 partial screenshots:

sql_setup_part1.png

sql_setup_part2.png

You don’t need the whole thing in one image.

✅ Option 3: Screenshot results instead (recommended)
Much more valuable screenshots are:

✅ Tables & views list

✅ SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SERVICE_EVENTS;

✅ SELECT * FROM VW_COST_BY_DEPARTMENT;

✅ SELECT * FROM VW_MONTHLY_TREND;

These prove:

Your SQL ran

Your data is correct

Your views work

That’s stronger proof than showing long SQL text.

🧠 What matters most for GitHub
✅ SQL files in sql/ folder (this is the real deliverable)

✅ Screenshots of results (proof it works)

❌ You do NOT need a screenshot of the full script

🎯 Short answer
It’s completely okay. Don’t screenshot the big SQL script.
Save it as .sql files and upload to GitHub. Screenshot the results instead.

That’s actually more professional.

If you want, tell me what files you currently have in your project folder and I’ll suggest the cleanest GitHub structure for you.


You said:
should i only upload the full script or the script in parts on github 

ChatGPT said:
Great question — and this is one of those “looks small but matters a lot” portfolio decisions.

🟢 Short answer (what I recommend)
✅ Upload the script in parts (multiple .sql files)
➕ You can also include a full combined script, but it’s optional.

🧠 Why split scripts is better (and more professional)
When you split like this:

01_create_tables.sql

02_create_views.sql

03_kpi_queries.sql

You show that you understand:

📦 Separation of concerns (DDL vs views vs analysis)

🔁 Reproducibility (run in order, step by step)

🧑‍💼 Real-world workflow (this is how teams organize SQL)

📚 Readability (reviewer can open only what they need)

This makes your project look:

More structured

More “industry-style”

Easier to review for recruiters/interviewers

🆚 What about one big script?
One big all_in_one.sql:

❌ Harder to read

❌ Harder to debug

❌ Looks more like a “dump”

✅ Still okay technically

❌ Less professional for portfolio

🏆 Best practice for your GitHub repo
Do this:

sql/
  01_create_tables.sql
  02_create_views.sql
  03_kpi_queries.sql
(Optional)

sql/
  00_full_setup.sql   ← contains everything in one file (optional)
In your README, write:

“Run SQL scripts in order: 01 → 02 → 03”

🎯 What recruiters/interviewers like
They like seeing:

Clear structure

Logical flow

Small, focused files

Easy-to-follow setup

Splitting scripts signals maturity even for a junior profile.

✅ Final recommendation
✔️ Upload scripts in parts (definitely do this)

➕ Optionally also upload one full combined script

❌ Don’t upload only one huge file

If you want, paste the names of the files you’re planning to create and I’ll help you organize them perfectly for GitHub.

✅ How to use these (and explain in GitHub)
Run in this order in Snowflake:

You said:
done , how to upload to github

ChatGPT said:
Nice, you’re at the fun part now 😄 Let’s get your work online on GitHub. I’ll give you two easy ways. Pick the one you prefer.

✅ Method 1: Easiest (Using GitHub website, no commands)
1️⃣ Create a repository
Go to github.com and log in

Click New repository

Name it something like:

service-fleet-analytics
Set it to Public (good for portfolio)

(Optional) Check Add a README

Click Create repository

2️⃣ Upload your files
Open your new repo on GitHub

Click Add file → Upload files

Drag & drop:

sql/ folder (with 01_create_tables.sql, 02_create_views.sql, 03_kpi_queries.sql)

notebooks/ (if you have it)

screenshots/

Any other project files you want (README, etc.)

Scroll down

In Commit message, write:

Initial commit: Snowflake SQL setup and data cleaning
Click Commit changes

✅ Done. Your project is now on GitHub.

✅ Method 2: Using GitHub Desktop (clean workflow)
If you want a more “developer-style” way:

Install GitHub Desktop

Open it → File → Clone repository

Choose your service-fleet-analytics repo

Copy your project files into that folder on your PC

Go back to GitHub Desktop:

You’ll see the file changes

Write commit message:

Add Snowflake SQL scripts and project structure
Click Commit to main

Click Push origin

✅ Now it’s uploaded.

📁 What should be in your repo (example)
Your GitHub should show something like:

service-fleet-analytics/
  sql/
    01_create_tables.sql
    02_create_views.sql
    03_kpi_queries.sql
  notebooks/
    01_clean.ipynb
  screenshots/
    snowflake_objects.png
    service_events_count.png
  README.md
🧠 Important tip
You can upload now, and later:

Add Power BI file

Update README

Add more screenshots
GitHub is made for incremental updates.

🎯 Short answer
Create repo → Upload folders/files → Commit → Done ✅

If you tell me which method you’re using (GitHub website or GitHub Desktop), I can guide you click-by-click for your exact screen.


You said:
description

ChatGPT said:
Got it — you want a short, clean description for your GitHub repository. Here are a few good options. Pick one (or tweak it slightly):

✅ Simple & Professional
End-to-end service fleet analytics project using Python, Snowflake, and Power BI, covering data cleaning, SQL-based KPIs, analytical views, and dashboard-ready datasets.

✅ Slightly More Impact
Portfolio project demonstrating an end-to-end analytics workflow: Python for data cleaning, Snowflake for data modeling and SQL analytics, and Power BI for visualization (dashboard to be added).

✅ Short & Crisp (GitHub-style)
End-to-end service fleet analytics using Python, Snowflake SQL, and Power BI.

✅ More Business-Focused
Service fleet performance and cost analytics project using Python, Snowflake, and Power BI, focused on trends, high-risk assets, department workload, and maintenance costs.

If you want, tell me the exact roles you’re targeting (Data Analyst, Ops Analyst, RevOps, etc.), and I can tailor this description to match those jobs even better.


You said:
they have moved to patch instead of main

ChatGPT said:
No worries — that just means your default branch is named patch instead of main. Your code is not lost. You’ve got a few easy options:

✅ Option A (Simplest): Keep using patch
This is totally fine for a portfolio repo.

Your files are already on patch ✅

The repo works exactly the same ✅

You can continue committing to patch and share the repo link

If you don’t care about the branch name, you’re done.

🔁 Option B (Recommended): Make patch → main
Using GitHub website (no commands):
Open your repo on GitHub

Go to Settings (top right of the repo)

Click Branches (left sidebar)

Under Default branch, click Change

Select patch → set it as default

(Optional) Rename patch to main:

Go to Code → Branches

Click the ✏️ (rename) icon next to patch

Rename it to main

GitHub will auto-handle redirects

Now your repo’s main branch will be main (or at least default).

🧩 Option C: Merge patch into main (if both exist)
If you already have both branches:

Go to Pull requests

Click New pull request

Base: main ← Compare: patch

Click Create pull request

Click Merge

Now main will have everything from patch.

🧠 What I recommend for you
👉 Either set patch as the default branch or rename it to main.
Both are perfectly fine and look professional.

🎯 Quick check
Open your repo and see:

Do your files show up when you open the repo?
If yes → your work is safe and published.

If you want, tell me:

Are you using GitHub website or GitHub Desktop?

Do you see both main and patch branches or only patch?

I’ll guide you click-by-click for your exact screen.

ChatGPT said:
Perfect—that’s normal. Let’s fill it with a clean, professional README you can paste right now.

# Service Fleet Analytics

End-to-end analytics project using **Python**, **Snowflake (SQL)**, and **Power BI** to analyze service fleet operations, identify high-risk assets, understand department workload, and evaluate maintenance cost impact.

> Status: Snowflake data model and SQL views complete. Power BI dashboard will be added next.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a complete analytics workflow:

1. **Data Cleaning (Python / pandas)**  
   - Cleaned raw service fleet data
   - Handled missing values, duplicates, and date normalization
   - Exported analysis-ready CSV files

2. **Data Warehouse (Snowflake)**  
   - Loaded data into staging and final tables
   - Converted formatted cost values (e.g., `1,033.04`) into numeric safely
   - Built analytical tables and views for reporting

3. **Analytics & BI (SQL + Power BI)**  
   - Created SQL views for:
     - Monthly service trends
     - High-risk assets (most serviced)
     - Department-wise service workload
     - Cost by department
   - These views are used as the data source for the Power BI dashboard

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Python** (pandas) – data cleaning & preparation  
- **Snowflake** – data warehousing & SQL analytics  
- **SQL** – transformations, KPIs, and analytical views  
- **Power BI** – dashboarding (to be added)

## 🛠️ How to Reproduce (Snowflake)

1. Run:
   - `sql/01_create_tables.sql`  
   This creates the database, tables, and builds the final `SERVICE_EVENTS` table from the RAW table.

2. Load CSVs via Snowflake UI:
   - `data_clean/assets_clean.csv` → `ASSETS`
   - `data_clean/service_events_clean.csv` → `SERVICE_EVENTS_RAW`  
   (Make sure **First row is header** is enabled.)

3. Run:
   - `sql/02_create_views.sql` to create all analytical views.

4. (Optional) Run:
   - `sql/03_kpi_queries.sql` to validate data and generate KPI results.

5. In Power BI:
   - Connect to Snowflake
   - Load these views:
     - `VW_MONTHLY_TREND`
     - `VW_DEPARTMENT_TREND`
     - `VW_HIGH_RISK_ASSETS`
     - `VW_COST_BY_DEPARTMENT`

## 📊 Key Business Questions Answered

- How does service volume change month over month?
- Which assets are most frequently serviced (high-risk)?
- Which departments generate the most service requests?
- Where is maintenance cost concentrated across departments?

## 🎯 Why This Project

This project is built as a **portfolio case study** to demonstrate:
- Real-world data cleaning
- Cloud data warehousing concepts
- SQL-based analytics and modeling
- BI-ready data preparation
- Reproducible analytics workflow

## 📌 Next Steps

- Build and add the **Power BI dashboard**
- Add dashboard screenshots and `.pbix` file to the repo
- Extend analysis with additional KPIs (e.g., resolution time, asset reliability)
If you want, I can shorten this, make it more technical, or tailor it to a specific role (Data Analyst, Ops Analyst, RevOps, etc.).
